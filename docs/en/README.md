# WAX Docs (unofficial)

Currently all articles are scattered across the different guild websites. This is very annoying, because many websites are not well SEO optimized and a google search mostly does not lead to any helpful articles. We know that there are already some **great content producers** on the WAX Blockchain and we would like to increase the accessibility by centralizing the content on a single documentation site.

This documentation site is completely hosted on GitHub pages and all the articles can be found on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Blacklusion/wax-docs).
> Feel free to make changes to existing articles by using the "Edit on GitHub" button or to add new articles by creating a pull request.
