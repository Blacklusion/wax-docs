# WAX Docs (unofficial)

Currently all articles are scattered across the different guild websites. This is not only unpractical,but a google search mostly does not lead to any helpful articles, because many websites are not very well SEO optimized. We know that there are already some **great content producers** on the WAX Blockchain and we would like to increase the accessibility by centralizing the content on a single documentation site.

This documentation site is completely open source and hosted on GitHub pages. All the articles can be found on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Blacklusion/wax-docs).
> Feel free to make changes to existing articles by using the "Edit on github" button or to add new articles by creating a pull request.

### Multilanguage support ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³
This documentation site supports multilanguage support out of the box. So, regardless of your language you can contribute to this documentation, either by translating existing articles or adding new ones specifically for your demographic.
